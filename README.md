# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System



I create functional safety documents based on what you learned in the lessons. These documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.


### Description of Repo Files

This repo contains all the files to complete the car nanodegree functional safety project. We are also providing the same files in a google drive folder. Here is the link to the Google Drive folder: [Link to templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByaZfGJuntGTQWRpNUpuNVVGNlU)


The repo contains a PDF file called **Project_Instructions.pdf**. This document gives information about how to approach the project and what is expected. In the project template folder, there are five files in the folder for developing solutions:


* 01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.doc

* 02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.xlsx

* 03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc

* 04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc

* 05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.doc

The repo also contains an Architecture_Diagrams folder containing visuals that I will need to complete the reports. These visuals are in no particular order, and I will decide in which document or documents they belong.


### Software

To complete the project, I use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com). 

There are also open source word processors such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/]) and [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org).
